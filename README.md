## Introduction

The purpose of this report is to visualize historic rental bike data in New York City in order to search for trends that can lead to actionable insights. In a large city such as New York a diverse array of transportation options will always be necessary to serve the population and keep traffic congestion to a minimum. Bike rentals are one option of many and should be encouraged because of the availability of bike lanes and the benefit of being an environmentally friendly selection.

For the purposes of this assignment, I chose to complete two tasks:
- Break down the distribution of ages by region of the New York City area.
- Show the percentage of users returned the bikes within the time restriction set by CitiBike's service.

## Data Preparation

Before we can begin preparing visuals, we must fix the data to make our tasks possible.
